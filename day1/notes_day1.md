# 🧠 Day 1 - Introduction to Agents & Agentic Architectures

### 📘 Overview

Day 1 of the **Google x Kaggle AI Agents Intensive** introduced the core concept of **AI Agents** - systems that can think, plan, act, and observe autonomously.

Agents are not just language models responding to prompts; they are **goal-oriented entities** that can use tools, interact with environments, and collaborate with other agents.

### 🔍 Key Concepts Learned

- **Agent Definition:**  
  An agent is an AI system capable of _thinking (reasoning)_, _acting (executing tasks)_, and _observing (learning from feedback)_.

- **Agent Loop (Think → Act → Observe):**  
  This is the fundamental operational cycle of all agents.

- **ADK (Agent Development Kit):**  
  A toolkit by Google for building, debugging, and running agents locally and on the cloud.

- **Components of an Agent System:**
  - 🧠 **Model (Brain):** Handles reasoning and decision-making.
  - 🧰 **Tools (Hands):** APIs, search, or custom modules that help agents act.
  - ⚡ **Orchestration Layer (Nervous System):** Manages planning, memory, and task execution.

### 💻 Hands-On Work

- Explored the **Gemini + ADK** integration on Kaggle.
- Built a **simple agent** that performs reasoning and returns results.
- Created a **multi-agent system (MAS)** to understand collaboration between agents.
- Used the **ADK Web Interface** to visualize invocations and traces.

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Agents are **autonomous problem-solvers**, not static LLMs.
- They can chain multiple tools and other agents to achieve goals.
- Developers act more like **directors** - guiding and debugging, not hardcoding logic.
