# 🧩 Day 2 - Agent Tools & Interoperability (Model Context Protocol - MCP)

### 📘 Overview

Day 2 of the **Google x Kaggle AI Agents Intensive** focused on how agents move beyond reasoning to take real actions through **tools** and communicate seamlessly across systems via **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**.

This unit introduced the concept of **tool-enabled agents** — systems that can execute code, retrieve data, interact with APIs, and work within human-approved boundaries.

### 🔍 Key Concepts Learned

- **Agent Tools:**  
  Tools extend an agent’s capabilities to perform actions such as computations, data retrieval, or API calls.  
  They transform a model from being just a reasoning engine into an _operator_ capable of acting in the real world.

- **Model Context Protocol (MCP):**  
  An open standard that allows agents, tools, and external systems to communicate using a shared protocol.  
  MCP enables interoperability, helping agents collaborate across diverse applications and environments.

- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Workflows:**  
  Agents can pause long-running operations to request human approval before resuming tasks — a critical step for safety and reliability.

- **Tool Invocation Patterns:**  
  Agents can call tools in **sequential**, **parallel**, or **looped** workflows, allowing complex task orchestration.

### 💻 Hands-On Work

- Completed all **Day 2 Kaggle Codelabs (Gemini + ADK)**.
- Built **custom tools** and connected them with agent workflows.
- Observed **real-time tool calls and traces** in the ADK Web Interface.
- Experimented with **Long-Running Operations (LROs)** that include human approval flows.
- Understood how **MCP** manages tool registration, validation, and cross-system communication.

### 💡 Key Takeaways

- Tools give agents the power to act — bridging the gap between thought and execution.
- MCP standardizes communication between agents and tools, making complex AI systems interoperable.
- Human-in-the-loop workflows ensure safety and control in autonomous systems.
- The ADK simplifies building, managing, and visualizing multi-agent tool interactions.
