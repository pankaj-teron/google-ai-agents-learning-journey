This is one of the areas where AI is having the most profound and rapid impact. Here's a breakdown of the key trends and breakthroughs:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Analyzing complex biological data:** AI excels at sifting through massive datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and clinical trials. It can identify novel disease targets (e.g., specific proteins or genes involved in a disease) that human researchers might miss.\n*   **Predicting target druggability:** AI models can assess whether a potential target is \"druggable\" – meaning whether it's feasible to design a molecule that can interact with it to achieve a therapeutic effect. This saves significant time and resources by avoiding pursuits of unpromising targets.\n\n**2.

Enhanced Lead Optimization:**\n\n*   **Predicting ADMET properties:** AI models are becoming increasingly accurate at predicting a drug candidate's Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADMET) properties. This allows researchers to quickly identify and filter out compounds likely to fail later in development due to poor bioavailability or safety concerns.\n*   **Fine-tuning molecular structures:** AI can suggest specific modifications to a lead compound to improve its efficacy, reduce side effects, or enhance its stability.\n\n**4. Drug Repurposing with AI:**\n\n*   **Identifying new uses for existing drugs:** AI can analyze vast amounts of data, including scientific literature, clinical trial results, and patient records, to find existing approved drugs that might be effective against different diseases. This offers a much faster and less risky path to new treatments.\n*   **Systematic screening:** AI can perform systematic \"virtual screenings\" of millions of existing compounds against new disease targets.\n\n**5. Advanced Computational Approaches:**\n\n*   **Reinforcement learning:** Used to iteratively refine drug designs by rewarding successful modifications and penalizing unfavorable outcomes.\n*   **Graph neural networks (GNNs):** Particularly well-suited for representing and analyzing molecular structures, enabling more sophisticated predictions about their behavior.\n*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Used to extract valuable information from unstructured text data like research papers and patents, accelerating knowledge discovery.\n\n**6.

This is indeed one of the most exciting and transformative areas.\n\nLet me elaborate on how AI is revolutionizing the design and creation of new drug molecules:\n\n**The Traditional Approach vs. AI's Innovation:**\n\n*   **Traditional Drug Discovery:** For decades, drug discovery often involved a process of screening vast libraries of existing compounds, modifying them slightly based on medicinal chemist intuition and empirical testing, and hoping to stumble upon a successful candidate. This was a time-consuming, expensive, and often serendipitous process.\n*   **AI-Driven Design:** AI, particularly generative AI and deep learning, is shifting this paradigm. Instead of just screening and modifying, AI can now **create entirely new molecules from scratch** that have never existed before.\n\n**How AI Generates Novel Molecules:**\n\n1.  **Learning Molecular Principles:**\n    *   AI models are trained on massive datasets of known molecules, their properties, and their chemical structures. This allows them to learn the fundamental rules of chemistry, the relationships between structure and function, and what constitutes a \"valid\" and \"effective\" molecule.\n    *   They learn about common molecular scaffolds, functional groups, and how different atoms bond together.\n\n2.  **Generative Models:**\n    *   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** These consist of two neural networks: a generator that creates new molecules and a discriminator that tries to distinguish between real molecules and AI-generated ones. Through this adversarial process, the generator gets progressively better at creating realistic and promising molecular structures.\n    *   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** These models learn a compressed \"latent space\" representation of molecules. By sampling from this latent space and decoding, they can generate novel molecular structures.\n    *   **Transformer Models (similar to those used in language):** These are increasingly being adapted for molecular generation, treating molecules as sequences of \"atoms\" or \"tokens.\"\n\n3.  **Defining Desired Properties (The \"Prompt\" for the AI):**\n    *   Crucially, researchers don't just ask the AI to \"make a molecule.\" They provide specific **constraints and desired properties** that the generated molecule should possess. This is often referred to as \"goal-directed generation\" or \"conditional generation.\" These properties can include:\n        *   **Target Binding Affinity:** How strongly the molecule will bind to a specific disease-related protein.\n        *   **Selectivity:** Ensuring the molecule binds only to the intended target and not others, to minimize off-target side effects.\n        *   **Solubility:** How well the molecule dissolves in water or bodily fluids.\n        *   **Permeability:** The ability of the molecule to cross biological membranes (e.g., to enter cells).\n        *   **Reduced Toxicity:** Designing molecules that are less likely to cause harm.\n        *   **Synthesizability:** Ensuring the molecule can actually be made in a lab using practical chemical reactions.\n\n4.  **Iterative Refinement and Optimization:**\n    *   The AI might generate a promising molecule, but it's rarely perfect on the first try. The process is often iterative.\n    *   The generated molecule is then evaluated (often through computational simulations or early lab tests).\n    *   The feedback from this evaluation is used to \"retrain\" or adjust the AI model, guiding it to generate even better molecules in subsequent rounds.\n\n**Why This is a Game-Changer:**\n\n*   **Exploring Vast Chemical Space:** The number of possible drug-like molecules is astronomically large (estimated to be over 10^60). AI can explore this space much more efficiently than human chemists.\n*   **Designing for Specificity:** AI can be trained to design molecules that are highly specific for a particular target, which is a major challenge in traditional drug discovery and a key factor in reducing side effects.\n*   **\"Black Box\" Breakthroughs:** Sometimes, AI can come up with novel molecular designs that are counter-intuitive to human chemists but prove highly effective. This allows for breakthroughs that might have been missed by conventional approaches.\n*   **Speed and Efficiency:** By automating the early stages of molecular design, AI significantly accelerates the pace of discovery.\n\n**Example:**\n\nImagine a researcher wants to find a new drug to inhibit a specific enzyme implicated in cancer. They would feed the AI:\n*   The 3D structure of the enzyme's binding site.\n*   Desired properties like high binding affinity, good oral bioavailability, and low predicted toxicity.\n\nThe AI then uses its generative models to propose numerous novel molecular structures that are predicted to fit the enzyme's binding site and meet the specified criteria. These candidates are then prioritized for further experimental validation.\n\nThis capability is fundamentally changing the \"discovery\" aspect of drug discovery, moving from a search-and-modify approach to a design-and-create approach.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies leveraging AI for novel molecule design and generation is rapidly evolving, but here are some of the **main players and categories of companies** involved:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
